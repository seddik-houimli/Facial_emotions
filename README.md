# Facial_Emotions_Recognition
- ✨ Hello World,✨

This github repository is part of a research study made in order to do the benchmarking between the different AI cloud service providers such as: 
1) Azure Automated Machine Learning Studio
2) Google Cloud | Vertex AI
3) AWS SageMaker Studio

> Note: This repository is subdivide into 4 main directories each is serving a certain cause.

| Directory | Cause |
| ------ | ------ |
| Data_Preparation | Notebook needed to do the local data preparation. |
| Azure_AutoML | Notebook needed to do the dataset creation on azure autoML and a set of generated files. |
| Google_AutoML |Notebook needed to do the dataset creation on azure autoML and a set of generated files. |
| Metrics |Notebook needed to generate the metrics for the different plateforms using the Confusion Matrix.  |
- For AWS SageMaker we didn't need to create a notebook since the platforme supported no code solutions for image datasets.
